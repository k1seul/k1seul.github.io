Hello! I'm Hansul Kim, a Deep Learning research student passionate about Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neuroscience. I graduated from Sungkyunkwan University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (Neuroscience track). Currently, I'm delving into mathematically based Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In the future, I aspire to research and teach in these fields
