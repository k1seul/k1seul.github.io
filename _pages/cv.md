Summary:
Hello! My name is Hanseul Kim, a curious being wandering around multiple fields of interest hoping to find that one bluebird. I graduated from Sungkyunkwan Univ. (SKKU), South Korea, majoring in biomedical engineering and neuroscience. I had tried multiple research internships in my undergraduate working with neurological data and reinforcement learning and also did an internship at Samsung Medical Center, South Korea as a machine learning/data science researcher. My research topics of interest are understanding the human brain and artificial agents' neural networks by comparing them.
